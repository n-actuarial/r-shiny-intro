## Assessment (a.k.a Time to show your skills)

*Note: I recommend starting with the assessment and learn while doing it if you are too bored to go through all materials*

Learning is mostly about practicing

> “Practice makes perfect. After a long time of practicing, our work will become natural, skillful, swift, and steady.” ― Bruce Lee

But,

> “Practice does not make perfect. Only **perfect practice** makes perfect.” ― Vince Lombardi

Now, you are require to create a shiny app based on [this Excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/n-actuarial/r-shiny-intro/blob/main/R%20Shiny%20Assignment.xlsx) (refers inside for **inputs, outputs & some other labels**)

To pass this assessment, you need to fulfill this list of requirements :upside_down_face:

1. Create a working shiny app that reproduce the correct results as in the Excel spreadsheet
2. Create a public repo at your own GitHub account
3. Commit & push your shiny app and/or code changes to GitHub
4. Deploy it to shinyapps.io or other hosting providers
5. Wrap the whole shiny app into R package **[Optional]**
6. Use GitHub Action for CI/CD **[Optional]**

After you satisfied with your work, you may then send the links of your GitHub repo (app source code) & the hosted web app (live Shiny app) to [Jone Keat](jonekeat.lim@n-actuarial.com) and cc [Debbie](minjyeh.ooi@n-actuarial.com)

Lastly, Jone Keat & Debbie shall assess your work & provide feedbacks to you through emails or Microsoft Teams meeting.
