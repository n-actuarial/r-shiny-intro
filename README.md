# An introduction to R Shiny

## Prerequisite

1. R programming
2. Rstudio or VS Code

## What you need to learn

1. Use R shiny to create web app
2. Create R package, including unit test, documentation, version control, etc
3. DevOps skills, eg CI/CD using Github Action, deployment

## R Style Guide

Although we assumed you already familiar with R programming, but even expert programmers will have their own preferred code styles. To improve coding experience, we strongly encourage you to follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html)

## Recommended way to learn

There is no best way to learn things, we usually learn by googling what we need & find answers in stackoverflow & other sites

But here is the sequence you may consider to follow:

1. Choose one of: [interactive course](https://rstudio-education.github.io/shiny-course/), [video](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) or [Mastering Shiny book](https://mastering-shiny.org/), then go through it
2. If you choose interactive course or video, you should go through [Mastering Shiny: Best practices](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-intro.html)
3. Then, you should read our internal GitHub doc (*\OneDrive\Work\TechDev\GitHub Handbook.pdf*) for our development practices, and only refers to corresponding chapters in [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) when needed, eg *'Connect Git, GitHub, RStudio'* when configure Git in Rstudio or *'Early GitHub Wins'* for R project setup
4. After that, learn to wrap shiny app into R package, you may read [Mastering Shiny: Packages](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-packaging.html) & [R Packages: The whole game](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html), and only read individual chapters when needed
5. Lastly, go through [Shiny articles: Deployment](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html), and try to deploy the app to shinyapps.io 

## Assessment (a.k.a Time to show your skills)

*Note: I recommend starting with the assessment and learn while doing it if you are too bored to go through all materials*

Learning is mostly about practicing

But,

> ‚ÄúPractice does not make perfect. Only **perfect practice** makes perfect.‚Äù ‚Äï Vince Lombardi

Now, you are require to create a shiny app based on [this Excel spreadsheet](https://github.com/n-actuarial/r-shiny-intro/blob/main/R%20Shiny%20Assignment.xlsx) (refers inside for **inputs, outputs & some other labels**)

To pass this assessment, you need to fulfill this list of requirements :upside_down_face:

1. Create a working shiny app that reproduce the correct results as in the Excel spreadsheet
2. Create a public repo at your own GitHub account
3. Commit & push your shiny app and/or code changes to GitHub
4. Deploy it to shinyapps.io or other hosting providers
5. Wrap the whole shiny app into R package **[Optional]**
6. Use GitHub Action for CI/CD **[Optional]**

After you satisfied with your work, you may then send the links of your GitHub repo (app source code) & the hosted web app (live Shiny app) to *Jone Keat* and cc *Debbie*

Lastly, Jone Keat & Debbie shall assess your work & provide feedbacks to you through emails or Microsoft Teams meeting.

## Further Study

Technically, shiny is a web application framework that tanslates R code to HTML. Therefore, it can work seemlessly with other web framework, and adding HTML, CSS & JS knowledge will definitely become helpful when building advance web application.
